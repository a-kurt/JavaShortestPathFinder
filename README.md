# JavaShortestPathFinder
JavaShortestPathFinder is a Java-based project that implements Dijkstra's and BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithms for efficient shortest path finding in a graph.

Features
    Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for weighted graphs.
    Implementation of BFS algorithm for unweighted graphs.
    Determine the shortest path between two nodes in 2D grid.
    Well-documented code with clear examples and usage instructions.

Usage
    Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/a-kurt/JavaShortestPathFinder.git
    Navigate to the project directory: cd JavaShortestPathFinder/src
    Compile the Java source files: javac *.java
    Run the program: java main

Examples

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use the JavaShortestPathFinder:

java

/*
  No need to specify int X_SIZE, int Y_SIZE. It is dynamic.
  File:
    First Line:   (y,x) of starting coordinate.
    Second Line:  (y,x) of end coordinate.
    Rest is grid which consists 0's and 1's. Program can travel in 0's. 1's are blocks.
*/
public TestCases(String FileName, int X_SIZE, int Y_SIZE) {
        this.FileName = FileName;
        this.X_SIZE = X_SIZE;
    	  this.Y_SIZE = Y_SIZE;
}
